In these code, we are going to see the methods by which we can search an element from an array.
This repository contains C++ implementations of two fundamental search algorithms: linear search and binary search. Both algorithms operate on a given array of integers and return the index of a specific target value if found, or -1 otherwise.

The linear search algorithm checks each element of the array in sequence until it finds the target value or reaches the end of the array. It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the array.

The binary search algorithm, on the other hand, is a more efficient search algorithm that requires the array to be sorted in ascending or descending order. It starts by comparing the target value with the middle element of the array. If they match, it returns the index of that element. Otherwise, it narrows down the search to either the left or right half of the array, depending on whether the target value is smaller or larger than the middle element. It repeats this process until it finds the target value or determines that it doesn't exist in the array. Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), which is much faster than linear search for large arrays.

The code in this repository includes separate C++ functions for implementing each algorithm, as well as a main() function that tests the functions with sample inputs. 

Feel free to use, modify, and share this code as you wish, and don't hesitate to contribute to this repository with your own implementations or improvements.
